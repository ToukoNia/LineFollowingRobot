# LineFollowingRobot

Code for ACS11002- Line following robot. This uses a PIC18F221 microcontroller, and a shadowbot hardware with an I2C added.

  This robot must automatically follow a white line on the floor in a circle, while having its speed set from a pacer robot in front (via distance sensors)

  The robot will then switch lanes after crossing the line twice, and continue tll its passed once, then will do a 180 and repeat to exit.
